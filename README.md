# BilibiliPlayer

A modern C++17 multimedia player application built with Qt6 and designed with a focus on user experience and performance.

## 🎯 Project Overview

BilibiliPlayer is a cross-platform multimedia player that demonstrates modern C++ development practices and Qt6 capabilities. This project serves as an experimental showcase exploring the potential of AI-assisted development, specifically investigating how effectively AI tools like Claude Sonnet can collaborate with human developers to create substantial software projects.

**Yes, this README.md is almost generated by AI, too. : )**

## 🔬 AI Development Experiment

This project represents a unique development experiment where approximately **95%** of the codebase was generated through AI assistance (Claude Sonnet 4), with human oversight providing:
- Architecture decisions and design patterns
- Code reviews and optimization suggestions  
- Integration testing and debugging
- Project management and feature requirements

The experiment aims to understand:
- The current capabilities and limitations of AI in software development
- Common challenges encountered in AI-human collaborative coding
- Best practices for AI-assisted development workflows
- Quality and maintainability of AI-generated code

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++17
- **UI Framework**: Qt 6.8
- **Build System**: CMake with Conan package management
- **Architecture**: Modern C++ with RAII, smart pointers, and Qt's signal-slot system
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, <s>Linux, macOS</s>)

## 📦 Build System

The project uses a hybrid build approach:
- **Conan**: Manages C++ dependencies and build configuration
- **External Qt6.8**: Uses a prebuilt Qt6.8 installation outside of Conan for optimal performance
- **CMake**: Handles the build process with custom presets for debug/release configurations

## 🔧 Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- **Compiler**: GCC 8+, Clang 7+, or MSVC 2019+
- **CMake**: Version 3.16 or higher
- **Conan**: Version 2.0+
- **Qt6.8**: Prebuilt installation (not managed by Conan)

### Build Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd BilibiliPlayer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with Conan**:
   ```bash
   # For Debug build
   conan install . --output-folder=build/<build_type> --build=missing --settings=build_type=Debug
   
   # For Release build
   conan install . --output-folder=build/<build_type> --build=missing --settings=build_type=Release
   ```

3. **Configure with CMake**:
   ```bash
   # Debug configuration
   cmake --preset conan-debug
   
   # Release configuration  
   cmake --preset conan-release
   ```

4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   # Debug build
   cmake --build --preset conan-debug
   
   # Release build
   cmake --build --preset conan-release
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   # From build directory
   ./build/<build_type>/src/BilibiliPlayer      # Linux/macOS
   .\build\<build_type>\src\BilibiliPlayer.exe  # Windows
   ```

## � Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Qt6
- **Playlist Management**: Hierarchical category and playlist organization
- **Multi-format Support**: Various audio and video format compatibility via FFmpeg
- **Configuration System**: Flexible, workspace-based configuration management
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring
- **Network Streaming**: Support for online media streaming with HTTPS support
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, with Linux and macOS support planned
